# Python-Data-Analysis
These are data analysis exercises that I completed with my Udemy courses in 2020
The Capstone Project is an analysis of 911 call data from kaggle, with visualisations with Seaborn

Random forest project, K Nearest Neighbours and Logistic Regression produce visualisations 
in Seaborn and investigate basic modelling concepts using sklearn
